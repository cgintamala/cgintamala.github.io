Pleasant story, it's nice to see the evolution of the character through the years and how life change, new relationships, new goals and milestones.\n\nA lot of easter eggs and little interactions you can do in the game, from Zelda Game Cube games to Donnie Darko DVD, at first glance seems a very simple and straightforward games, and it's, but with you look closer, you can found a lot of good stuff hidden in there"

      "Trailmakers honestly helped me calm down and drive down memory lane, but in some levels it's really annoying that the game has its own idea of how and where to put stuff. You should wait for a sale, then it's definitely worth it"
